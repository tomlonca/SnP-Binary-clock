# SnP-Binary-clock

This project is the design and implementation of a binary clock using an AtMega48 Microprocessor and a circuit trace (PCB trace)

## Overview
The goal is to create a **binary clock**, with a normal, sleep and lower power mode. It should be able to change from one another using three buttons on top of the (es. plaqueta)

# Available Files

BinaryClock_pcb, BinaryClock_pcb, BinaryClock_pcb are the necessary files for the circuit layout.
